> **Technical terms and concepts of RSC Chain**

## A

### **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**
Artificial Intelligence integrated into every component of RSC Chain for automatic optimization and intelligent decision making.

### **Autoencoder**
Neural network that learns to compress and reconstruct data, used for anomaly detection in RSC Chain.

### **Federated Learning**
Machine learning technique that allows training models without sharing sensitive data, maintaining privacy.

## B

### **Blockchain**
Distributed chain of blocks that records transactions in an immutable and decentralized manner.

### **Bloom Filter**
Probabilistic data structure used to quickly verify if an element belongs to a set.

### **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**
Ability of a distributed system to function correctly even when some nodes fail or act maliciously.

## C

### **Consensus**
Mechanism by which network nodes agree on the state of the blockchain.

### **Hybrid Consensus**
System that combines multiple consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, VRF) for greater security and efficiency.

### **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
Cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum computing attacks.

### **ConvNet (Convolutional Neural Network)**
Convolutional neural network used for analysis of spatial patterns in transactions.

## D

### **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)**
Distributed hash table that enables efficient searches in P2P networks.

### **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**
Attack that attempts to disrupt a network's service by flooding it with malicious traffic.

### **Deep Learning**
Subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

## E

### **Epoch**
Time period during which a specific set of validators is maintained in PoS consensus.

### **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**
Virtual machine that executes smart contracts on the blockchain.

## F

### **Federated Learning**
Machine learning technique that allows training models in a distributed manner without sharing data.

### **Finality**
Guarantee that a transaction will never be reversed once confirmed.

### **Firewall L7**
Security system that filters traffic at the application level (OSI model layer 7).

## G

### **Gossip Protocol**
Communication protocol that propagates messages epidemically in distributed networks.

### **GNN (Graph Neural Network)**
Neural network specialized in processing structured data such as graphs.

### **Gas**
Unit of measurement for the computational cost of executing operations on the blockchain.

## H

### **Hash**
Mathematical function that converts input data into a fixed-length character string.

### **Hot Wallet**
Wallet connected to the Internet for frequent transactions.

### **Hybrid Consensus**
Consensus system that combines multiple mechanisms for greater robustness.

## I

### **Isolation Forest**
Anomaly detection algorithm based on the isolation principle.

### **Interoperability**
Ability of different blockchains to communicate and share data.
